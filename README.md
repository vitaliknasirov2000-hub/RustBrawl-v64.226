# RustBrawl
Open-source server emulator for Supercell’s game Brawl Stars, written in Rust.

# READ THIS !!
This is the first time I’ve ever written anything in Rust
And, yes, i know, i mixed PascalCase and camelCase instead of using snake_case.
And i don't give a fck.

if you’re the kind of person who cries over naming conventions, then fck off.
You're not the target audience.

# What is this?
a wheelchaired attempt at making a Brawl Stars Server Emulator in rust.
dont expect this to work for production.

# Why I can't get to lobby?
Because this is just the core.
It doesn’t have all packets implemented.
**Implement them yourself.**

# Why Rust?
because i wanted to suffer and learn new things
(spoiler: it worked)
