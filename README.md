# RustBrawl
Open-source server emulator for Supercell’s game Brawl Stars 64.226, written in Rust.

# READ THIS !!
This is the first time I’ve ever written anything in Rust
Yes, I know I mixed ``PascalCase`` and ``camelCase`` instead of following Rust’s ``snake_case`` convention.

# What is this?
An experimental attempt at creating a Brawl Stars server emulator in Rust.
Don’t expect this to work in production it’s mostly for learning and fun.

# Client
You need to implement the client yourself.
(Ill probably make a client someday… but im lazy..)
